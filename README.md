## 🔍 What is Exploratory Data Analysis?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in the data science pipeline. It involves:
- Understanding the structure of the data
- Identifying missing or inconsistent values
- Analyzing distributions and relationships
- Visualizing trends, correlations, and outliers

EDA helps in making data-driven decisions and choosing appropriate modeling strategies.
